* Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything.
* Ship.

On Politics

* We will invent an economic system that doesn't need patents or copyright
* Who governs least governs best

On Technology
-------------
* We shall merge with machines, before they overtake us
* Technology decentralizes business and politics
* Flying cars are just helicopters

On Philosophy
-------------
* Morals are just emotional heuristics for maintaining social order
* Free will doesn't exist, nor does that matter
* There is no single, consistent self

On Spirituality
---------------
* We don't have a purpose given to us - we create our own
* We do not have immortal souls
* There are no god(s)

On Education
------------
* The higher education bubble is already collapsing

Meta

* Who I am changes
* Show me where I'm wrong, so I can learn what's right
* Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)
